# code-snippets
Snippets of code from various challenges, projects, etc. Each with a neat focus.

I will try and keep everything organized for people who stumble upon this repository. There are some quick tips I have for readers.

## 1. Use these for inspiration and ideas.
## 2. Do not use these verbatim on code challenges if you stumble upon a live challenge that this code fits. That's cheating and plagarism (even though it's MIT license it still is very unethical). You should always use code that matches your style and you came up with. Feel free to get hints and ideas from my code though.
## 3. If you use this code somewhere please throw me a credit. It's not required, but just nice.
## 4. Have Fun!

Someday I'll hope to use some of this code to write a book. We shall see if that ever comes to fruition.
