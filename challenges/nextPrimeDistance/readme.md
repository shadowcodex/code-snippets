# nextPrimeDistances

You are given a non-negative integer `number`. Your task is to find the closest prime `number` to it, and calculate the distance between them.

Example

* For `number = 0`, the output should be `primeDistance(number) = 2`.

The closest prime number to `0` is `2`, so the answer is `2 - 0 = 2`.

* For `number = 11`, the output should be `primeDistance(number) = 0`.

`11` is a prime number, so the answer is `11 - 11 = 0`.
